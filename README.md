# Python-input-Function
In Python, most programs need to collect information from users, such as their name, age or a number. This is done using the input() function, which:

    Pauses the program and waits for the user to type something.
    Returns the entered value as a string (str).
    Optionally displays a prompt message to guide the user.

Unlike some languages that rely on dialog boxes, Python keeps it simple by taking input directly from the console.

This program asks the user for a value, stores it as a string and then prints it back.

example:

answer = input("Who is the best player?")

print("Yes, that's right.", answer, "is the best footballer in history.")

Output:

Who is the best player?messi

Yes, that's right. messi is the best footballer in history.
